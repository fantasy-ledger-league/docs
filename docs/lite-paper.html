<h1>Fantasy Ledger League Lite Paper</h1>

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Fantasy sports have always been a space where skill, strategy, and community come together. With the rise of blockchain technology, we now have the tools to enhance this experience further by introducing NFT ownership and a native token economy. <strong>Fantasy Ledger League (FLL)</strong> combines the excitement of fantasy football with the innovation of blockchain, creating a dynamic ecosystem where team owners, fans, and participants are deeply connected and rewarded for their engagement.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Vision</strong></h2>
<p>FLL aims to create the ultimate fantasy football league by combining:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exclusive team ownership</strong> through NFTs.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance-based rewards</strong> for team owners as well as their fans.</li>
  <li>A token economy that rewards engagement, performance, and loyalty.</li>
  <li>A seamless experience leveraging Yahoo Fantasy Football for gameplay.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our goal is to cater to experienced fantasy football players while building a vibrant fan base that supports and engages with the league throughout the season.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Core Features</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>1. Leagues</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>We will launch initially with a single league (the "Professional" League), which is an extraordinarily exclusive collection of merely 12 NFTs, with each variation representing one of the Professional League's teams.</li>
  <li>If successful, we plan to launch additional, less exclusive, and less expensive Leagues in the future.
    <ul>
      <li>Semi-Pro League: 120 NFTs, each representing ownership of one of 12 teams in 10 separate fantasy football leagues.</li>
      <li>Amateur League: 1,200 NFTs, each representing ownership of one of 12 teams in 100 separate fantasy football leagues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>2. Team NFT Collection</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each team in the league is represented by a unique NFT.</li>
  <li>NFTs grant the owner exclusive rights to manage their team for the season.</li>
  <li>At the end of the season, new NFTs are issued for the following year. Current owners automatically receive the new season's NFT unless they are inactive, in which case their team is auctioned off. Proceeds from the auction go to the previous owner.</li>
  <li>Previous years' NFTs may be burnt or kept as a collectible item, but will no longer have any utility otherwise after the season ends.</li>
  <li>Given that this is a highly exclusive collection where NFTs are not expected to change hands often, it bears a relatively high royalty on secondary sales of 18%.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>3. Fan NFT Collection</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tiered Fan NFTs: Each fan NFT is assigned a tier upon minting:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Casual Fan</strong>: Common, smaller rewards.</li>
      <li><strong>Dedicated Fan</strong>: Uncommon, moderate rewards.</li>
      <li><strong>Superfan</strong>: Rare, with the largest rewards.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Holders of Fans NFTs:
    <ul>
      <li>Earn $FLL token rewards based on their team's performance (e.g., wins, fantasy points scored).</li>
      <li>Gain additional rewards if their chosen team wins the championship.</li>
      <li>Access private team-specific Discord channels.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fan NFTs come with a royalty on secondary sales of only 8%.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>4. Discord Integration</strong></h3>
<p>FLL's Discord will be a hub for interaction and community building:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Team-Specific Channels</strong>: Private channels for each team, accessible only to verified Fan NFT holders for that team. Fans receive roles based on their NFT tier (e.g., Casual Fan, Dedicated Fan, Superfan).</li>
  <li><strong>Matchup Channels</strong>: Short-lived public channels created for each weekly matchup, where fans and observers can chat. A bot will auto-post score updates for the two teams in the channel.</li>
  <li><strong>Polls and Voting</strong>: Team owners can create polls in their private team channels, allowing fans to vote on decisions like trade proposals or other team strategies.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>5. $FLL Token Integration</strong></h3>
<p>The $FLL token is the lifeblood of the league's economy, used for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Team Owner Rewards</strong>: Performance-based payouts for team owners.</li>
  <li><strong>Fan Rewards</strong>: Performance-based payouts for Fans NFT holders.</li>
  <li><strong>FAB Boosts</strong>: Team owners can purchase additional Free Agent Budget (FAB) to strengthen their team during the season.</li>
  <li><strong>Priority Waiver Picks</strong>: Owners can spend tokens to jump the waiver wire priority for a week.</li>
  <li><strong>Team Customization</strong>: Team owners can spend tokens to customize their team name or logo (offseason only).</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>6. Revenue Sharing for Championship</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>50% of the revenue from NFT secondary sales is allocated to a <strong>Championship Reward Pool</strong>.</li>
  <li>The pool is shared between the owner and the fans of the championship-winning team at the end of the season.</li>
  <li>This aligns fan engagement with team success and creates an exciting end-of-season dynamic.</li>
  <li>The remaining 50% of the revenue from NFT secondary sales will support ongoing development initiatives.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>7. Event-Based NFT Rewards</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Special NFTs may be issued for milestones like:
    <ul>
      <li>Weekly high scores.</li>
      <li>Biggest blowouts.</li>
      <li>Playoff victories.</li>
      <li>League championship.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These NFTs can be traded or held as collectibles, adding another layer of competition and value.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>8. Active Team Management</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Owners can:
    <ul>
      <li>Adjust rosters and lineups via Yahoo Fantasy Football.</li>
      <li>Use FAB boosts or priority waiver picks for strategic advantage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Weekly matchups and performance determine token and fan rewards, ensuring continuous engagement.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Economic Model</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>NFT Ownership and Revenue</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Team NFTs and Fan NFTs</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>50% of the initial XRP raised from minting will be allocated to ensuring price stability and protecting NFT holder value by maintaining a strong price floor at 1/2 of the original mint price; this will be done after minting by programmatically placing buy orders with no expiration date. This mechanism provides confidence to holders by limiting downside risk while supporting natural market dynamics.</li>
      <li>Remaining 50% allocated to:
        <ul>
          <li>AMM liquidity for $FLL token (30%)</li>
          <li>League operations and development (10%)</li>
          <li>Treasury reserve (10%)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Additional Revenue Mechanics</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>NFT secondary market trades generate royalties (Teams collection: 18%; Fans collection: 8%), which will fund continual development.</li>
      <li>Fans NFTs generate performance-based token rewards, driving secondary market activity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Token Distribution</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance Rewards</strong>: Token payouts tied to team performance (e.g., wins, fantasy points scored).</li>
  <li><strong>Championship Bonuses</strong>: Large token rewards for the championship-winning team and their fans.</li>
  <li><strong>Customization Purchases</strong>: Tokens spent on customizations are burned to reduce supply, maintaining token value.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Initial token allocation:
    <ul>
      <li>50% allocated for fan and performance rewards.</li>
      <li>30% reserved for league operations and development.</li>
      <li>20% reserved for ecosystem growth (e.g., partnerships, marketing).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Token supply decays over time (e.g., annual reward reductions) to promote early adoption and long-term sustainability.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Key Challenges and Solutions</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inactive Owners</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Inactive teams are auctioned off, ensuring the league remains competitive. Team owners will have ample opportunity to claim team ownership for the following year; however, to prevent ending up with inactive teams in the league, non-responsive owners will have the following year's NFT auctioned off, the proceeds of which will go 100% to the current team owner.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Token Inflation</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Burning tokens through customizations and auctions helps control supply.</li>
      <li>New and compelling use cases for the $FLL token will increase it's utility over time and, as a result, it's value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Yahoo Integration Limitations</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Focus gameplay features within Yahoo, with external token mechanics handled via the FLL web app.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Future Vision</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Expand into other fantasy sports, creating a multi-sport ecosystem.</li>
  <li>Develop a proprietary fantasy platform to integrate gameplay and blockchain mechanics more tightly.</li>
  <li>Introduce governance features, allowing token holders to vote on league rules or reward structures.</li>
  <li>Gamify fan participation further with prediction contests and challenges.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

With a comprehensive token economy, unique NFT collections, and a sustainable revenue-sharing model, FLL is poised to redefine what it means to play and engage in fantasy sports.
