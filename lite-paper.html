  <h1>Fantasy Ledger League Lite Paper</h1>

  <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Fantasy sports have always been a space where skill, strategy, and community come together. 
    Now, with the rise of blockchain technology, we're revolutionizing fantasy football by 
    creating true digital team ownership that mirrors the prestige and value of owning a 
    professional sports franchise. <strong>Fantasy Ledger League (FLL)</strong> transforms the 
    traditional fantasy experience into an exclusive digital sports ownership platform, where 
    team owners build long-term franchise value, cultivate a dedicated fan base, and participate 
    in a thriving token economy. Just as NFL team owners see their franchises appreciate over 
    time, FLL team owners can develop their team's brand, engage with supporters, and potentially 
    sell their franchise for a profit - all while competing for glory in an elite fantasy 
    football environment.
  </p>

  <h2><strong>Vision</strong></h2>
  <p>FLL aims to create the ultimate fantasy football league by combining:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Exclusive team ownership through NFTs.</li>
    <li>Performance-based rewards for team owners as well as their fans.</li>
    <li>A token economy that rewards engagement, performance, and loyalty.</li>
    <li>A seamless experience leveraging Yahoo Fantasy Football for gameplay.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Our goal is to cater to experienced fantasy football players while building a vibrant fan 
  base that supports and engages with the league throughout the season.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2><strong>Core Features</strong></h2>

  <h3><strong>1. Leagues</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We will launch initially with a single league (the "Professional" League), which is an 
    incredibly exclusive collection of merely 12 NFTs, with each variation representing one 
    of the Professional League's teams.</li>
    <li>If successful, we plan to launch additional, less exclusive, and less expensive Leagues 
    in the future.
      <ul>
        <li>Semi-Pro League: 120 NFTs, each representing ownership of one of 12 teams in 10 
        separate fantasy football leagues.</li>
        <li>Amateur League: 1,200 NFTs, each representing ownership of one of 12 teams in 100 
        separate fantasy football leagues.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>2. Teams NFT Collection</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each team in the league is represented by a unique NFT.</li>
    <li>NFTs grant the owner exclusive rights to manage their team for the season.</li>
    <li>At the end of the season, new NFTs are issued for the following year. Current owners 
    automatically receive the new season's NFT for free (unless they are inactive, in which case 
    their team is auctioned off with proceeds going to the previous owner).</li>
    <li>Previous years' NFTs may be kept or traded as a collectible item, but will no longer have 
    any utility otherwise after the season ends.</li>
    <li>Given that this is a highly exclusive collection where NFTs are not expected to change 
    hands often, it bears a relatively high royalty on secondary sales of 18%.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>3. Fans NFT Collection</strong></h3>
  <p>The Fans NFT Collection is designed to create an engaged community of supporters around each team. 
  By allowing fans to have a stake in their favorite team's success through NFT ownership, we create 
  a more interactive and rewarding fantasy football experience that extends beyond just the team owners. 
  These NFTs enable fans to earn rewards based on their team's performance while fostering a strong 
  sense of community through exclusive access and benefits.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tiered Fan NFTs: Each fan NFT is assigned a tier upon minting:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Casual Fan</strong>: Common, smaller rewards.</li>
        <li><strong>Dedicated Fan</strong>: Uncommon, moderate rewards.</li>
        <li><strong>Superfan</strong>: Rare, with the largest rewards.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Holders of Fans NFTs:
      <ul>
        <li>Earn $FLL token rewards based on their team's performance (e.g., wins, fantasy points 
        scored).</li>
        <li>Gain additional rewards if their chosen team wins the championship.</li>
        <li>Access private team-specific Discord channels.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fan NFTs come with a royalty on secondary sales of 8%.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>4. $FLL Token Integration</strong></h3>
  <p>The $FLL token is a native XRPL token that serves as the lifeblood of the league's economy. 
  By leveraging the speed, low cost, and sustainability of the XRP Ledger, we can provide 
  seamless token transactions for our community. The token is used for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Team Owner Rewards</strong>: Performance-based payouts for team owners.</li>
    <li><strong>Fan Rewards</strong>: Performance-based payouts for Fans NFT holders.</li>
    <li><strong>Free Agent Budget Boosts</strong>: Team owners can purchase additional Free Agent Budget (FAB) 
    to strengthen their team during the season.</li>
    <li><strong>Priority Waiver Picks</strong>: Owners can spend tokens to jump the waiver wire 
    priority for a week.</li>
    <li><strong>Team Customization</strong>: Team owners can spend tokens to customize their team 
    name or logo (offseason only).</li>
    <li>And more utility to be added over time...</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>5. Revenue Sharing for Championship</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>50%</strong> of the revenue from NFT secondary sales is allocated to a <strong>Championship Reward 
    Pool</strong>.</li>
    <li>The pool is shared between the owner and the fans of the championship-winning team at the 
    end of the season.</li>
    <li>This aligns fan engagement with team success and creates an exciting end-of-season 
    dynamic.</li>
    <li>The remaining 50% of the revenue from NFT secondary sales will support ongoing development 
    initiatives.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>6. Active Team Management</strong></h3>
  <p>The core fantasy football gameplay takes place entirely within Yahoo Fantasy Football, where team owners 
    participate just like in any traditional fantasy league. This includes all the standard activities like 
    drafting players, setting weekly lineups, making waiver claims, proposing trades, and monitoring player 
    injuries and stats. The key difference is that an owner's performance and strategic decisions now impact 
    not just their own success, but also the rewards earned by their community of Fan NFT holders.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Within Yahoo Fantasy Football, owners can:
      <ul>
        <li>Draft their initial team</li>
        <li>Set and adjust weekly lineups</li>
        <li>Add/drop players through waivers</li>
        <li>Propose and accept trades</li>
        <li>Monitor player injuries and statistics</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Through FLL's additional layer, owners can:
      <ul>
        <li>Use $FLL tokens for FAB boosts to increase waiver spending power</li>
        <li>Purchase priority waiver positions for key pickups</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Team performance in Yahoo directly determines weekly token and fan rewards, creating deeper 
    engagement between owners and their fan communities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>7. Event-Based NFT Rewards</strong></h3>
  <p>To celebrate exceptional achievements and create additional excitement throughout the season, 
    FLL features a system of collectible commemorative NFTs that recognize outstanding performances and memorable moments. 
    These NFTs serve purely as collectible digital mementos with no additional utility.</p>
  <p>Special NFTs in a separate NFT collection may be issued for milestones like weekly high scores, biggest blowouts, playoff victories, 
    and league championships. These NFTs can be traded or held as collectibles, adding another layer of 
    competition and value.</p>

  <h3><strong>8. Discord Integration</strong></h3>
  <p>FLL's Discord will be a hub for interaction and community building:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Team-Specific Channels</strong>: Private channels for each team, accessible only 
    to verified Fan NFT holders for that team. Fans receive roles based on their NFT tier (e.g., 
    Casual Fan, Dedicated Fan, Superfan).</li>
    <li><strong>Matchup Channels</strong>: Short-lived public channels created for each weekly 
    matchup, where fans and observers can chat. A bot will auto-post score updates for the two 
    teams in the channel.</li>
    <li><strong>Polls and Voting</strong>: Team owners can create polls in their private team 
    channels, allowing fans to vote on decisions like trade proposals or other team strategies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>Economic Model</strong></h2>

  <h3><strong>NFT Ownership and Revenue</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Team NFTs and Fan NFTs</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>50% of the initial XRP raised from minting will be allocated to ensuring price 
        stability and protecting NFT holder value by maintaining a strong price floor at a minimum of 1/2 of 
        the original mint price; this will be done after minting by programmatically placing buy 
        orders from our treasury with no expiration date. This mechanism provides confidence to holders by limiting 
        downside risk while supporting natural market dynamics.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For example, a Team NFT minting for 5000 XRP would have a guaranteed floor price of 
            2500 XRP through programmatic buy orders, protecting holder value while enabling 
            upside potential.
          </li>
          <li>In the event that a buy offer from our treasury for a Team NFT does get accepted,
            that Team NFT will be auctioned back off to the market.</li>
        </ul> 
        <li>The remaining 50% of the XRP raised from minting will be allocated to:
          <ul>
            <li>AMM liquidity for $FLL token (30%)</li>
            <li>League operations and development (10%)</li>
            <li>Treasury reserve (10%)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial token allocation:
      <ul>
        <li>35% allocated for performance rewards for team owners and fans.</li>
        <li>35% allocated for AMM liquidity (paired with XRP from mint proceeds).</li>
        <li>20% reserved for league operations and development.</li>
        <li>10% reserved for ecosystem growth (e.g., partnerships, marketing).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Token supply decays over time (e.g., annual reward reductions) to promote early adoption 
    and long-term sustainability.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2><strong>Key Challenges and Solutions</strong></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inactive Owners</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Inactive teams are auctioned off, ensuring the league remains competitive. Team owners 
        will have ample opportunity to claim team ownership for the following year; however, to 
        prevent ending up with inactive teams in the league, non-responsive owners will have the 
        following year's NFT auctioned off, the proceeds of which will go to the current 
        team owner (minus the 18% royalty).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Token Inflation</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Burning tokens through customizations and auctions helps control supply.</li>
        <li>New and compelling use cases for the $FLL token will increase it's utility over time 
        and, as a result, it's value.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Yahoo Integration Limitations</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Focus gameplay features within Yahoo, with external token mechanics handled via the 
        FLL web app.</li>
        <li>Yahoo's APIs have limitations in terms of data access and automation capabilities, requiring 
          some manual operational work to ensure smooth league functioning.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2><strong>Future Vision</strong></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop a proprietary fantasy platform to integrate gameplay and blockchain mechanics more 
    tightly; migrate off of Yahoo Fantasy Football.</li>
    <li>Introduce governance features, allowing token holders to vote on league rules or reward 
    structures.</li>
    <li>Gamify fan participation further with prediction contests and challenges.</li>
    <li>Expand into other fantasy sports, creating a multi-sport ecosystem.</li>
  </ul>
